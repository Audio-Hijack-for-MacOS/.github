## 📦 What is Audio Hijack for Mac?

**Audio Hijack Pro for Mac** is a professional-grade audio recording and sound manipulation tool built specifically for macOS. It allows you to capture and record audio from virtually any source — applications, web browsers, streaming services, microphones, mixers, or even the entire system sound. Whether you’re producing a podcast, archiving a live stream, or recording an online call, Audio Hijack makes the process seamless and reliable.  

One of the standout features of **Audio Hijack Mac** is its **block-based interface**, which lets you design custom audio workflows. You can visually drag and connect modules for recording, playback, effects, and routing.

The app also integrates **real-time audio processing**, enabling you to apply EQ, compression, reverb, and other professional effects while recording. Podcasters love Audio Hijack because it simplifies multi-source recording (microphone + system audio + remote guest) into one clean session, while educators and musicians rely on it for clarity and flexibility during lectures, lessons, or live performances.  

Unlike many basic recorders, **Audio Hijack for macOS** is optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs, ensuring smooth performance and minimal CPU usage.
